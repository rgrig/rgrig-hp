<a href="http://rgrig.github.com/topl/">TOPL</a> is a runtime verifier
of temporal properties for Java programs.

<a href="https://github.com/rgrig/homework-eval">HomeworkEval</a>
is a web application I used to quickly grade programming homeworks.

<h1>Old Research</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/seplogic/jstar">jStar</a>
  is a Java program verifier that uses separation logic for annotations.
The main authors are Matthew Parkinson and Dino Distefano;
  I used to help improve it.
(You should use
  <a href="http://fbinfer.com/">Facebook's Infer</a>,
  though.)
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/rgrig/freeboogie">FreeBoogie</a>
is a verification condition generator for the 
<a href="https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie">
Boogie language</a>.
I used it during my PhD work to do some experiments,
  because Boogie was not open source at the time.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESC/Java">ESC/Java</a>
is a static verifier for Java programs annotated with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Modeling_Language">JML</a>. 
I implemented a big part of the
<a href="/static/papers/janota2007raa.pdf">reachability analysis</a>
that is activated by the <span class="mono">-era</span> flag.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://clops.sf.net/">CLOPS</a> is a domain specific language,
a tool, and a library that make it easy to write Java programs with
a command line interface. I contributed to its design.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/michal.moskal/fx7/">Fx7</a>
  is an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT</a>
  solver.
I wrote a small module for simplifying
formulas in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0713">
certain circumstances</a>.
